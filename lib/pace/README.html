<h1 id="Pace"><a href="#Pace" class="headerlink" title="Pace"></a>Pace</h1><p>A node.js module that outputs a progress bar and other metrics to the command-line.<br>It was originally conceived to help measure the ‘pace’ of long running scripts.<br>We’ve used it to optimize scripts that would have taken hours to complete down<br>to minutes, without having to wait the hours before knowing that the script<br>could use some optimization.</p>
<h2 id="Installation"><a href="#Installation" class="headerlink" title="Installation"></a>Installation</h2><pre><code>$ npm install pace
</code></pre><h2 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h2><p>Running the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var total = 50000,
    count = 0,
    pace = require(&#39;pace&#39;)(total);

while (count++ &lt; total) {
  pace.op();

  // Cause some work to be done.
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {
    count = count;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Will cause output to your console similar to:</p>

<h2 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage"></a>Usage</h2><h3 id="Pace-object"><a href="#Pace-object" class="headerlink" title="Pace object"></a><code>Pace</code> object</h3><p>The module exports a factory function to generate instances of <code>Pace</code> objects.<br>So <code>require(&#39;pace&#39;)(&lt;options&gt;)</code> creates an instance of <code>Pace</code>, passing<br><code>options</code> to the constructor.</p>
<h3 id="Options"><a href="#Options" class="headerlink" title="Options"></a>Options</h3><p>Options can either be an object literal, or an integer.  If its an integer then<br>it is the same as passing options with only the <code>total</code> specified.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">require(&#39;pace&#39;)(100);

// Same as

require(&#39;pace&#39;)({total: 100});
</code></pre>
<p>Supported Options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>total</code> - The total number of operations that _YOUR_ script will execute.</li>
<li><code>maxBurden</code> - The maximum ‘burden’ that the progress bar should incur. See more about burden below.</li>
<li><code>showBurden</code> - Mostly for debugging.  Show the current burden / skipped steps with the other metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pace-op-count"><a href="#pace-op-count" class="headerlink" title="pace.op([count])"></a>pace.op([count])</h3><p>Signal to pace that an operation was completed in your script by calling<br><code>pace.op()</code>.</p>
<p>If you would rather track the progress in your own logic, you can call<br><code>pace.op(&lt;count&gt;)</code> where <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> is the current operation interation<br>(for example step # 50 of a 100 step process).</p>
<h3 id="pace-total"><a href="#pace-total" class="headerlink" title="pace.total"></a>pace.total</h3><p>If your script has a dynamic amount of work to do (for example, depending on the<br>results of previous operation there may be more steps to complete), you can<br>freely change the value of pace.total.  Just set the value like: <code>pace.total = 200</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Burden"><a href="#Burden" class="headerlink" title="Burden"></a>Burden</h2><p>Depending on how intensive your operations are, calculating, formatting, and<br>printing the progress bar might be much more expensive than the work you<br>are doing.  It would be silly if printing a progress bar caused your<br>job to take significantly longer than it would have otherwise. _Pace_ tracks<br>a stat called ‘burden’, which is basically a percentage of the overall<br>execution time that is being spent inside the progress bar logic itself.</p>
<p>The default <code>maxBurden</code> is <code>0.5</code>, which translates to <code>0.5% of the total execution
time</code>.  If this low burden is causing you to see progress reported less<br>often than you would prefer, you can raise it to something like <code>20</code> (20%) via<br>the <code>maxBurden</code> option.</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>The <code>test/</code> folder contains some simple test scripts you can run to see the<br>progress bar in action.</p>
