For example you have fixed a bug. You also have optimized some code. Optimization is not related to a bug. These should be submitted as separate pull requests. This way I can easily choose what to include. It is also easier to understand the code changes. Commit messages should be descriptive and full sentences.</p>
<p>Do not commit minified versions. Do not touch the version number. Make the pull requests against <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/commits/1.9.x">1.9.x branch</a>.</p>

They might be different than yours. It is not a holy war. Just follow then original. Use spaces, no tabs.</p>
